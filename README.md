# Carbon-Foot-Print-project
an application that creates objects of each of the three classes, 
places references to those objects in ArrayList<CarbonFootprint>, 
then iterates through the Array-List, 
polymorphically invoking each object’s getCarbonFootprint method. 
For each object, print some identifying information and the object’s carbon footprint.
